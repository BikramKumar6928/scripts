# scripts
Collection of scripts I wrote for my daily usage

I moved to linux and have decided to write some scripts for daily working.

# List of scripts added 

## convert-ts-to-mkv

The MPV is having an issue in seeking in ts files. I do not know MPV, so I tried to write a script that will convert the ts files I download to mkv files, which have better seeking.

It takes the file name as input and converts it to mkv with a fixed setting in ffmpeg.

## space-to-dash

Coming from windows, I had all my files with spaces in them. So created this script to recursively replace spaces in filenames to dashes. 

The character to replace and the character to replace with are configurable, so it can be used for substituting other characters too.

## magisk-flash

It is a work in progress. The end goal is to automatically pull recovery images, patch it and flash it using the laptop itself. I will work on it, but not very frequently.
